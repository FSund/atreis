# Atreis keyboard

Unsplitting the Iris keyboard.

Based on [Keebio's Iris keyboard design files](https://github.com/keebio/iris-case),
modified to achieve the same layout in a single-piece form-factor.

## Why ?

Because the Iris is perfect, but a splitted keyboard is not the most convenient
keyboard to take when on the go.

And because we can.

## Why this name ?

Because it looks a lot like the [Atreus](https://github.com/technomancy/atreus) keyboard, but with the Iris layout.

## How do I build one ?

Unfortunately, I'm not planning on designing a PCB for it, so you're on your own
to laser-cut the plates and hand-wire it.

# Firmware

I will add support for this keyboard to [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).
